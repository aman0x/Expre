              <ul>
                <li><strong>What does Expre mean?</strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">Expre word meaning “to experience.”</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>How much does it cost to participate in Expre?</strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">People who are hosting only (not travelling) do not pay any fees (although donations are welcome). Travellers pay a fee only when they are travelling. When their application for travel is approved, their Letter of Introduction receives a stamp which is good for one year from the date of approval. Travellers’ fees vary depending on age, whether you are a host, and whether you are travelling internationally or domestically. You should also expect that there will be other costs to travel. Although no money changes hands between host and traveller, a good practice is to bring a gift for your host. You may want to take your host out for dinner, cook a meal for them, pay for gas if they take you exploring, or otherwise contribute. You may have telephone costs, or additional transportation costs to get to their homes. It is important to remember that hosts in some countries may have fewer resources, and you don’t want to be a financial burden. At times, it can be a delicate balance–you need to balance your desire not to be a burden with cultural (and personal) norms of generosity and hospitality.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Why does Expre charge people to travel when other programs such as Couch Surfing and Hospitality Club are free? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none"> 1- There are basically two reasons why Expre charges a fee: While run entirely by volunteers, Expre does have administrative costs. As an international organization, Expre also has regular conferences and assemblies, and wealthier countries contribute to enable delegates from poorer countries to attend.</li>
                <li class="list-style-none">2- It is important to understand that the goal of Expre is not “free travel”. The ultimate goal of Expre is to build relationships and develop friendships, furthering the goals of building peace and understanding across the world. Many in Expre believe that free travel “cheapens” the experience and lessens the chance that people use it for the right reasons.</li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li><strong>How is Expre different from other hosting organizations? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">Expre is only one of a growing number of hospitality exchanges which all share the basic concept of offering free (or inexpensive) accommodation and an opportunity to network with people around the globe. There are a number of factors which set these networks apart, and it is important to do your research to choose the program that best matches your needs. Here are some of the differences: </li>
                <li class="">Underlying philosophy: All hospitality exchange networks promote the benefits of learning about the culture by interacting with the locals when you travel. Each matches the needs and interests of some travellers. Some hospitality exchange networks are unabashedly about providing free accommodation worldwide. Some cater to the specific needs of interest groups such as bicycle tourers, Mensa members or Mennonites. Expre’s purpose is to help build world peace, goodwill and understanding by providing opportunities for personal contacts among people of different cultures, backgrounds and nationalities. Its members value understanding of different cultures, gender equality and diversity in ethnicity, ideology, sexuality and nationality. To allow meaningful exchanges to take place, travellers are encouraged to stay at least two nights with a host, and hosts are expected to make time to interact with their guests.</li>
                <li class="">Reciprocity: Some hospitality exchanges require all travellers to reciprocate by offering accommodation for traveller. Expre allows members to register as travellers, or as hosts (or both), and many never travel, while others never host. Expre does encourage travellers to host and hosts to travel by offering lower travel fees for hosts who travel.</li>
                <li class="">Membership and approval process: For many networks, becoming a member is as easy as going online and creating a profile. Essentially self-policing, these hospitality exchanges rely on hosts and travellers to write reviews and report negative behaviours (as well as exemplary ones), so that bad travellers and hosts will be very quickly and publicly “outed.” At Expre, we believe that the only way to ensure that hosts and travellers subscribe to the goals and values described here, is to vet travellers and hosts before approving them. We require a personal interview with visit and letters of reference as part of the screening process. </li>
                <li class="">Cost: Some organizations are free for both travellers and hosts, while others have membership fees. Some allow hosts to charge travellers for accommodation. In Expre, it costs nothing to be a host (although donations are encouraged). Travellers pay fees only when they travel. No money changes hands between travellers and hosts for accommodation, although travellers are required to pay their own expenses (e.g., restaurant meals, sightseeing costs, etc. ) </li>
                <li class="">Finding hosts: Most hospitality systems use online databases with interactive maps to help travellers find hosts and communicate with them. At present, Expre emails (and in a few cases, mails) lists to travellers for the countries they wish to travel to. Expre International is in the process of developing a web application which will allow members to search for hosts online. </li>
              </ul>
              <h6 class="text-center"><strong>Travelling </strong></h6>
              <ul>
                <li class=""><strong>How do I know that I will be safe as a traveller or a host? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">When you travel or host with Expre, you know that your prospective hosts or guests have undergone an extensive interview and reference checking procedure to ensure that they subscribe to the values and philosophy of Expre. This reduces the risks associated with going into the homes of strangers or welcoming strangers into your home. Expre also encourages travellers and hosts to report behaviours that are unsafe or otherwise troubling, and these reports are acted on by representatives in the traveller’s or host’s country. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class=""><strong>If I want to travel with Expre, do I have to host? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">You do not need to host to travel with Expre. However, we believe that when you return from Expre travel, you will want to share your experiences with others! There are also financial benefits to you as a host if you travel. It is also important to note that you do not need to have the most luxurious accommodations to host. True Expre travellers put more stock in the hospitality and the relationship developed than they do in the comfort of the bed they sleep in.</li>
              </ul>

                <li class=""><strong> If I want to travel with Expre, do I have to host? </strong></li>

              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class=""><strong>Could I make my whole trip an Expre trip, travelling only with Expre? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">You should never plan to make your whole trip an “Expre trip”. First of all, while the rewards of experiencing life in another culture first hand are tremendous, it also takes effort on your part to be a good guest, and you will need to have breaks in between. Secondly, you will not always find Expre hosts in all the areas you travel. Expre hosts are not hotels, open with staff 24 hours a day. Unexpected things come up, and hosts occasionally have to cancel. You should always be prepared to fend for yourself if this happens. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class=""><strong> Are families welcome to travel with Expre? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">Expre is a great way for families to travel and one of the best ways to expose children to other cultures. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class=""><strong> I am under 18. Can I travel with Expre without my parents? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">Normally you must be 18 years of age or older to travel with Expre. In exceptional circumstances, minors may travel without a parent or a legal guardian if both families have agreed ahead of time, in writing, about guardianship and liability. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class=""><strong>If I am a host and want to travel, what is the process and cost? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">Expre hosts (listed in the current host list) travelling within India can visits other hosts without a validated Letter of Introduction (although you are encouraged to complete the LOI and send it to your prospective hosts as an introduction). There is no fee. Hosts who have hosted for at least one year may travel internationally for half the regular fee. Hosts must contact an interviewer, and may be required to submit new references. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class=""><strong>Can I invite non-Expre people to visit an Expre host with me? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">All the people who travel under the auspices of Expre must have been approved as Expre Travellers and have stamped Letters of Introduction valid for the period of travel. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class=""><strong>If I have travelled with Expre previously, do I need to complete another interview and references? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">If you have not been an Expre traveller for the last two years, then you would need to be re-interviewed if you are travelling outside of Canada. References are required if you have not hosted or had an active LOI in the last 5 years. </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class=""><strong> I have contacted many Expre hosts, and can’t find a place to stay. What can I do? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">It is important to understand that there is no guarantee of finding accommodation with Expre. Some areas do not have hosts. In heavily touristic areas, hosts may have more requests than they can handle. Some things you can do to increase the chances of finding hosts are: </li>
                <li class="">Choose places to visit that are a little more “out of the way”. Hosts in these areas are not as inundated with travellers and are often very anxious to have more visitors. </li>
                <li class="">Look for the “wmv” (want more visitors) notation in the host list. </li>
                <li>Be aware of the vacation season and travel habits of people in the countries you wish to travel to—in India, for example, many retired people travel south for long periods in the winter. Summer may be vacation season for families, making them less available. </li>
              </ul>
              <h6 class="text-center"><strong>Hosting </strong></h6>
              <ul>
                <li class=""><strong>Who can host on expre.com?  </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">We welcome people from anywhere in the world to sign up as a host on expre.com. It's free to sign up and list your experience on expre.com. You must be living in your home during the guest’s stay, and be available to spend a little time with them, to make it a truly authentic and unique travel experience for them with a local. However, you need to be of legal age within your country to host and if you are renting a property, we suggest you always check your rental/mortgage agreement and ensure you get your landlord’s permission if required. We encourage you to liaise with your local authorities to ensure you qualify to be a host family on expre.com </li>
                <li class=""><strong>Why should I become a host on expre.com?   </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">Expre.com is all about the host being present during the guest’s expre experience. We believe our hosts can add huge value to the guest experience by offering their local insights, view point and knowledge to the leisure guest allowing them to experience the local community and culture of the place they’re visiting. If you’ve got a talent to exhibit and would like to make some extra money, hosting guests in your area will enable you to meet new people from around the world and share in new experiences, interests, customs and stories. Hosts can accommodate leisure travellers/tourists looking for a genuine and real travel experience, students and people studying abroad, or on an internship in a local company. On Expre.com you can market your expre to a global audience. Visitors to the site can view profiles of hosts and their homes, see photos, browse destinations, read about the local area and compare prices. Uniquely, Expre.com hosts may also avail of additional bookings separate from Expre.com as many of our Local Partners have additional and separate demand for hosts outside of Expre.com. If this additional opportunity is available in your area, Expre.com may connect you with a Local Partner but you will be required to meet the standards of approval as required by the individual Local Partner including but not limited to a expre inspection. We look forward to welcoming you into our community of trusted hosts. </li>

                  <ul>
                    <li>Add your local amenities (In the amenities section) </li>
                    <li>Add weekly, monthly and single occupancy rates to encourage guests to book longer term if stays is included with you.</li>
                    <li>Set up the minimum stay at 1 night, our statistics show that if you allow shorter stays hosts can attract more guests. </li>
                    <li>Add identity documents, this allows guests to see that your identity is confirmed and gives them more confidence when booking to stay with you </li>
                    <li>The house and family description helps guests to get a better feel for where they would potentially be staying. </li>
                    <li>Pictures of your accommodation. Pictures of the exterior| bathroom| Kitchen| living room| garden will attract more attention to your listings and typically results in more bookings. </li>

                <li class=""><strong>What information will I need to provide when signing up? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">Your Expre profile should show off yourself and your experience. Make sure it looks its best so that you’ll capture the interest of potential guests. Start with a snappy title for your Expre. Something to grab attention on the listings page. Then write a descriptive introduction and upload some great photos. You should have no problem encouraging guests to read your full profile and book an experience! You’ll need to provide a description about yourself and your experience. This should include your interests and hobbies, the number of days, timings, facilities provided by you, directions to your place of experience, photos, house rules and other information as required. Guests love to read about a host’s interests and learn a little about the area they’ll be experiencing in and what to expect. Before going live, you'll also need to set up your rates and make sure your availability calendar is up-to-date. Hosts connected with a Local Partner are required to upload this documentation or show it to the Local Partner during the Expre visit. Hosts who are not connected to a Local Partner are not obliged to provide documentation but are encouraged to upload documentation when completing their profile. A verified profile gives interested guests peace of mind and security when choosing to book your experience so we encourage you to upload verification documentation when completing your profile. You can read more about this in the verification section. Please note documentation is never published on expre.com. Guests just see the verified badge on your profile. Our storage complies with the safe harbour regulations. All documents are encrypted, and only accessible with private tokens dynamically generated. </li>

                <li class=""><strong>Is there an approval process? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">If you're matched to a Local Partner, you will go through an approval process that includes a homestay visit and inspection by our Local Partner. If you're not matched to a Local Partner, we will review your homestay listing and activate it to go live on expre.com. A guest can only book your experience after they have contacted you through our messaging system to check if you are available for their dates of travel. You'll be notified of any new messages from guests about your availability by email and SMS. Once you review the details and confirm you are available on those dates, the guest can then go ahead and book your experience. You'll also receive an email confirmation once the guest has completed the booking process. </li>

                    <li>Up to date, clear photographs will demonstrate this. You should add in your description how clean your home is and how often it is cleaned. </li>
                    <li>We see lots of guest questions to host families before they book are regarding cleanliness and hygiene. </li>

                <li class=""><strong>How often will I be expected/can I expect to host? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">There is no frequency specified for accepting guests. You are not expected to accept guests if it is inconvenient for you to do so. (If you are going to be too busy to spend time with guests, it may be better that they go to a home where they will have a true Expre experience). But please, if someone contacts you, pay them the courtesy of responding, even if it is just to tell them that you are not available. How often you can expect to receive requests from visitors varies greatly with your location. If you live in a prime tourist area, you will likely get more requests. Many people living in areas more remote from major tourist attractions get fewer visitors — in some cases less than one a year. If you would like to increase the chances of visits, include “wmv” (want more visitors) in your host listing.

                <li class="list-style-none">Expre promotes trust, tolerance, open-mindedness and respect so that people can live in peaceful coexistence. When you join Expre, you agree not to discriminate on the basis of race, nationality, ideology, religion, or sexuality. However, Expre is a voluntary organization, and you are not required to host if it is inconvenient for you to do so because you have other plans. How often you host is up to you.

                <li class=""><strong> If I am a host, am I expected to provide meals and act as tour guide for my guests? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">Not unless you choose to. However, you are expected to spend time with guests, getting to know them and sharing information about your respective countries, customs, etc. Always remember that the goal of Expre is to promote peace and cross cultural understanding.

                <li class=""><strong> How long is a typical Expre homestay? </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">Expre visits are of any period depending on activities. Expre feels that you need this much time for cultural learning and friendships to develop. In some cases, hosts may invite you to stay longer. This is quite acceptable, but you should never ask to stay longer.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <ul>
                <li class=""><strong> How do I get paid?  </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">The guest pays a 100% deposit of an experience total on each booking online, this is retained by expre.com and is non-refundable.  You’ll receive the outstanding amount directly from the Expre 15 days after successful completion of your activity. You should include in your Expre profile how you would like to be paid, for instance by bank transfer, cash, PayPal or another payment method. If you’d like to take payment before arrival or if you have any cancellation policy you must add this to your profile so that the guest is aware before they make a booking. We recommend that you communicate with your guests after the booking is made and prior to their arrival and confirm your preferred payment method with them.

              <ul>
                <li class=""><strong> What if I feel unhappy with a guest?  </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">If you are feeling uncomfortable and feel a guest is not working out, not suited to your experience, you may ask the guest to leave. We would advise that you firstly try to resolve your differences and attempt to make the arrangement work out for both parties for the duration of the experience. In the event that you have an issue with your guest, we would recommend that you come to an amicable agreement with your guest that is fair for both parties. Although we are not party to the agreement we are always on hand to offer advice and support where we can. Please feel free to contact us should you need any help.

                <li class=""><strong>Why can't I call or email a guest or host before a booking request?  </strong></li>
                <li class="list-style-none">For your safety and security we do not permit potential guests any contact information belonging to hosts until after the booking is confirmed. Guests are required to pay the online booking fee with a valid Debit or credit card. Our messaging system which works like email automatically blocks any contact information email, phone, street address etc.  for host safety all your contact information are only shared after a reservation has been accepted. When you receive a request this opens a message thread where you can both ask questions, Video call etc before you decide if you wish to accept the guest.

 Partner are visited by them before being listed on the site. 
We have a verification process in place where we ask that hosts verify their email addresses, phone numbers and an identification document such as a passport or driver's license. 
We review every profile in detail before allowing the listing to appear on the website. 
Our hosts’ public profile will show their first name and won't give the specific location of their place of experience. It will only show the general area in which their place is located. Guests will only receive their host’s full name, address and contact details after they have made a confirmed booking and have paid their 100% non-refundable booking deposit. 
Our storage complies with the safe harbour regulations. All documents are encrypted, and only accessible with private tokens dynamically generated.

Once booked, get in touch with your guest(s) before they arrive and introduce yourself. Ask them to email you a photo and details of any other people (or pets if appropriate) in their booking party. 
Ask your guest(s) to advise you of their expected time of arrival and make sure they know how to get to your experience. 
Check your emails regularly for booking notifications and reminders. Reply to guests as soon as possible and always take an action for pending requests such as Accepting or Declining if necessaryu.
